<h1 align="center">Stack</h1>

A [Stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)) is an Abstract Data Type which is primarily used as a container of entities. 
It is well-known for its L.I.F.O. (Last-in-First-out) property, meaning that the last element inserted in the Stack is the first one to be removed. 
Therefore, all elements that were added before have to be removed after the new element.
