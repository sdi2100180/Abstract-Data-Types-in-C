<h1 align="center">Priority Queue</h1>

A [Priority Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Priority_queue) is an Abstract Data Type that behaves similarly to the normal Queue except that each element has some priority, 
which means that the element with the highest priority would come first in a Priority Queue. 
The priority of the elements in a Priority Queue will determine the order in which elements are removed from the priority queue.<br>
*This implementation of Priority Queue uses linked list.*
