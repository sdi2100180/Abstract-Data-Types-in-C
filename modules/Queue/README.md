<h1 align="center">Queue</h1>

A [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type)) is an Abstract Data Type which is primarily used as a container of entities. It is well-known for its F.I.F.O. (First-in-First-out) property, meaning that the first element inserted in the Queue is the first one to be removed. Therefore, all elements that were added before have to be removed before the new element can be removed.
